# ChitChat (HTML+CSS Only)

## Overview

This is a very simple template with a tech-y feel, built on pure HTML5 and CSS3 that I whipped up within a few hours.  I've been using templates almost exclusively from [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) and [Skel](http://skel.io) for both my personal website and my client websites for almost two years now, so I thought: why not create a template of my own?

However, this template is a really simple template so please don't expect too much :)

Finally, the reason I created this template in the first place is not (just) to test my HTML+CSS skills; there's a HUGE surprise coming up related to this template - just look at the name of this template and see if you can figure out what the surprise will be about ;)

## Contents

This template consists of three pages total - ```index.html```, ```generic.html``` and ```elements.html```.  They all have a common header (fixed at the top of the page) and a common footer so when you navigate between the pages it should seem as if only the content is changing.  The ```index.html``` file contains the homepage of whatever website you plan to host and comes with a banner on top of everything where you can fill in your website/company name and your slogan/motto.  The ```generic.html``` file shows what a typical page on your website (should you use this template) should look like and the ```elements.html``` page shows you all of the pre-styled elements that come with the template.  In general, the ```index.html``` page should be the homepage/default page while the ```generic.html``` page should be copied and modified as many times as you need to for all the other pages on your website.  The ```elements.html``` page should be kept in a safe place for reference (for example, to see what types of buttons are available through the template).

## Credits

So, this template was about 99% of my work; however, I did some research and copied a few lines of code (and also a few ideas in general) off the internet.

Firstly, credits to [Skel](http://skel.io) and its template "Baseline" for the whole idea of a banner at the top of the homepage.  If I didn't see this template I would never think of creating a banner of any sort.

Secondly, credits to [Skel](http://skel.io) (again) for its handy 12-unit grid system.  Although I did NOT copy the code directly or use the software without providing attribution/their license, I did try to mimick it (albeit a poor attempt) using some simple CSS.  The grid system provided in my template also consists of 12 units, but instead of being called ```1u```-```12u```, the classes are just called ```one``` to ```twelve``` where ```.one``` divs are 1 unit wide (or rather, one-twelfth of a page wide) and ```.twelve``` divs are 12 units wide (full width).  All such divs collapse and become full-width (even the ```.one``` divs) below ```750px``` screen width.

Finally, credits to [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com) for teaching me how to change the color of the highlighting of an ```input``` form field when clicked.  In this case I did actually copy the code directly from their example and changed the color to suit my template.  The full link to that example/article can be found in a comment in the ```main.css``` file.
